\section{Introduction}
The Zeeman Effect, discovered by Pieter Zeeman, is a crucial phenomenon in modern physics that demonstrates the interaction between magnetic fields and atomic energy levels. This section introduces the theoretical background and significance of the Zeeman Effect.

\section{Theory}
\subsection{Quantum Explanation}
test  the quantum mechanical basis of the Zeeman Effect, including the role of magnetic dipole moments and energy level splitting.

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
Provide the equations governing the Zeeman Effect, such as:
\[
\Delta E = m_l \mu_B B
\]
where \( \Delta E \) is the energy shift, \( m_l \) is the magnetic quantum number, \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton, and \( B \) is the magnetic field strength.

\section{Experimental Setup}
THIs is me.
Describe the f used, including the spectrometer, light source, and magnetic field generator. Include a diagram if possible:

\section{Procedure}
Outline the steps taken to perform the experiment, including calibration, data collection, and analysis.

\section{Results}
Present the observed spectral line splitting and compare it with theoretical predictions. Include tables and graphs where necessary.

\section{Discussion}
Analyze the results, discuss sources of error, and evaluate the agreement between experimental and theoretical values.

\section{Conclusion}
Summarize the findings and their implications for understanding the Zeeman Effect.

\section*{References}
List all references used in the report, formatted appropriately.
